# ZCode timezone restore (v1, portable) - save as UTF-8 WITHOUT BOM
# - Undoes patch-zcode-timezone.ps1: writes back the previous USER-level TZ
#   value recorded in zcode-timezone-state.json, or simply deletes the user
#   TZ variable when the previous value was unset / the state file is missing.
# - After restoring, the machine-level TZ=UTC becomes effective again for
#   this user, i.e. ZCode cron schedules go back to UTC interpretation (the
#   pre-patch behaviour).
# - ZCode does NOT need to be closed; quit and relaunch it afterwards so it
#   re-reads the environment.
# Re-apply the patch with patch-zcode-timezone.bat
