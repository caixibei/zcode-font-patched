# ZCode timezone patch (v1, portable) - save as UTF-8 WITHOUT BOM
# - Makes ZCode schedule/automation cron fields fire on Shanghai time (UTC+8)
#   instead of UTC.
# - Root cause: this machine carries a MACHINE-level environment variable
#   TZ=UTC which overrides the correct Windows time zone (China Standard
#   Time). Electron/Node.js prefers the TZ env var when resolving the local
#   time zone, so ZCode sees "UTC" and interprets cron schedules 8 hours
#   early. (The Windows time zone itself is correct - only the env var lies.)
# - Patch = set the USER-level TZ=Asia/Shanghai. A user variable shadows the
#   machine variable for every process of this user, needs no admin rights
#   and leaves the machine value untouched.
# - Zone name: IANA "Asia/Shanghai" (resolved by Electron/Node ICU; verified
#   that Node reports UTC+8 with it). MSYS/Git Bash "date" ignores IANA names
#   and keeps printing GMT - cosmetic only, ZCode itself is unaffected.
# - ZCode does NOT need to be closed (no file locks involved): processes
#   started AFTER the patch pick up the new zone; a running ZCode keeps UTC
#   until it is quit and relaunched.
# - Idempotent: re-running detects the patch and writes nothing.
# - Restore point: zcode-timezone-state.json records the previous user TZ
#   value so restore-zcode-timezone.ps1 can put it back exactly.
# Revert with restore-zcode-timezone.bat
